  * test_results/browsers/<browser>/latest
      contains test results from the latest stable version of the specified
      browser on all operating systems where it is available
  * test_results/latest
      contains test results from the latest version of each browser on the
      latest version of each operating system
  * test_results/operating_systems/<OS>
      contains test results from latest stable version of each browser on
      the operating system specified
  * test_results/operating_systems/<OS>/<browser>
      contains test results from different versions of the specified browser

Test results here could be:
  * "not sent"
    no packet (dns or http, depending on the test being carried out) was sent
  * "deleted"
    byte was deleted before packet was sent
  * "terminator"
    terminator for host, path, params or query, depending on the test being
    carried out. A typical URL: http://host/path;params?query
  * "dot"
    denoting the period in the domain name that is replaced by the length of
    the name that follows
  * a string
    the string might contain \xXX and %XX. \xXX means a single byte with that
    hex encoding. %XX is not a notation. It just stands for itself, i.e. the
    3 bytes %, X and X.
