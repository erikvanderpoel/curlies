=== Introduction ===

This document is a design doc for an automated browser URL behavior testing tool. It describes the need for browser URL behavior testing, the current solution with this tool, and possible future plans to enhance the tool.

=== Background ===

There are many URL parsing, escaping and encoding details, and the implementations among different browsers on different platforms often differ in subtle ways. IT organizations are interested in being compatible with the major implementations, and in canonicalizing URLs for storage in our internal data structures. The tool described here will help people stay informed of the major implementations as they evolve over time. We also publish some of [http://curlies.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/test_results the differences between the browsers] and [http://code.google.com/p/curlies/wiki/RecommendationsForBrowserDevelopers recommendations] in the hope that they will align more.

=== Current Situation ===

Testing are being carried out across all major modern browsers (IE 6, 7, 8; Firefox 2, 3.0, 3.5;  Safari 3, 4; Chrome 2, 3; Opera 9) on all the major platforms (WinXP, WinVista, Mac and Linux), and without any proxy in place. Over [http://curlies.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/test_pages 1300 tests] are created to test various parts of the a URL (such as host, path and query, etc.) and HTML form submissions. The generated reports are available [http://curlies.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/test_results here]. Read the [http://code.google.com/p/curlies/source/browse/trunk/test_results/README README file] for how the results folders are organized. When viewing the results in code.google.com, click "View raw file" to see the well-formatted reports.
